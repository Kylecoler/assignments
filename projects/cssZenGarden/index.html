            <p> A demonstartion of what can be accomplished through <span>css</span>-based design. Select any style sheet from the list to load it into this page. Download the example <a href=""><span>D</span> HTML FILE</a> and <a href=""><span>D</span> CSS FILE</a></p>
            <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <span>DOMs</span>, broken <span>CSS</span> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the <span>W3C, WASP,</span> and the major browser creators.</p>
            <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and inviforating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>
            <h3>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>
            <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <span>CSS</span>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. the <span>HTML</span> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <span>CSS</span> file. Yes, really.</p>
            <p><span>CSS</span> allows complete and total control mover the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demostrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

            <h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
            <P>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <span>CSS 1 & 2</span> usage. <span>CSS 3 & 4</span> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <span>CSS</span> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirements we have is that your <span>CSS</span> validates.</P>
            <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <span>CSS</span> by now. When sticking to the guidlines you should see fairly consitent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days -- especially when you factor in mobile -- pikel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That's okay, but do test in as many as you can, Your design should work in at least IE9+ adn the latest Chrome, Firefox, IOS and Android browswers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
